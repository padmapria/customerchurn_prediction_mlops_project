The dataset I'm using for the project is fetched from the Coinbase Pro API and contains historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for the trading pair "ETH-USD" (Ethereum to US Dollar). The data has been collected at a granularity of 15 minutes, meaning that each data point represents a specific 15-minute interval.

According to the Coinbase API documentation¹²³, the columns in the dataset represent the following:

- **time**: The date and time of the trade in ISO 8601 format.
- **low**: The lowest price of the trade in the given time interval in USD.
- **high**: The highest price of the trade in the given time interval in USD.
- **open**: The opening price of the trade in the given time interval in USD.
- **close**: The closing price of the trade in the given time interval in USD.
- **volume**: The total amount of the ETH traded in the given time interval.

As part of the data retrieval process, I have set the granularity to 15 minutes, ensuring that each data point provides a comprehensive snapshot of the price movements and trading activity within that specific time interval.
